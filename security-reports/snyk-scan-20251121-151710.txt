Open Issues

 ✗ [MEDIUM] Information Exposure - X-Powered-By Header
   Path: server.js, line 6
   Info: Disable X-Powered-By header for your Express app (consider using Helmet middleware), because it exposes information about the used framework to potential attackers.

 ✗ [MEDIUM] Cleartext Transmission - HTTP Instead of HTTPS
   Path: node_modules/engine.io/node_modules/ws/lib/websocket-server.js, line 93
   Info: http.createServer uses HTTP which is an insecure protocol and should not be used in code due to cleartext transmission of information. Data in cleartext in a communication channel can be sniffed by unauthorized actors. Consider using the https module instead.

 ✗ [MEDIUM] Cleartext Transmission - HTTP Instead of HTTPS
   Path: node_modules/express/lib/application.js, line 634
   Info: http.createServer uses HTTP which is an insecure protocol and should not be used in code due to cleartext transmission of information. Data in cleartext in a communication channel can be sniffed by unauthorized actors. Consider using the https module instead.

 ✗ [MEDIUM] Cleartext Transmission - HTTP Instead of HTTPS
   Path: node_modules/socket.io/dist/index.js, line 222
   Info: http.createServer uses HTTP which is an insecure protocol and should not be used in code due to cleartext transmission of information. Data in cleartext in a communication channel can be sniffed by unauthorized actors. Consider using the https module instead.

 ✗ [MEDIUM] Cleartext Transmission - HTTP Instead of HTTPS
   Path: node_modules/ws/lib/websocket-server.js, line 88
   Info: http.createServer uses HTTP which is an insecure protocol and should not be used in code due to cleartext transmission of information. Data in cleartext in a communication channel can be sniffed by unauthorized actors. Consider using the https module instead.

 ✗ [MEDIUM] Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling
   Path: server.js, line 84
   Info: Expensive operation (a file system operation) is performed by an endpoint handler which does not use a rate-limiting mechanism. It may enable the attackers to perform Denial-of-service attacks. Consider using a rate-limiting middleware such as express-limit.

 ✗ [MEDIUM] Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
   Path: server.js, line 6
   Info: CSRF protection is disabled for your Express app. This allows the attackers to execute requests on a user's behalf.

 ✗ [HIGH] Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
   Path: node_modules/express/lib/router/index.js, line 585
   Info: Unsanitized user input from the request URL flows into match, where it is used to build a regular expression. This may result in a Regular expression Denial of Service attack (reDOS).

  [Medium] Container or Pod is running without root user control
  Info:    Container or Pod is running without root user control. Container or
           Pod could be running with full administrative privileges

  Resolve: Set `securityContext.runAsNonRoot` to `true`

  [Medium] Container or Pod is running without root user control
  Info:    Container or Pod is running without root user control. Container or
           Pod could be running with full administrative privileges

  Resolve: Set `securityContext.runAsNonRoot` to `true`

  [Medium] Container does not drop all default capabilities
  Info:    All default capabilities are not explicitly dropped. Containers are
           running with potentially unnecessary privileges

           required capabilities in `securityContext.capabilities.add`

  [Medium] Container is running without privilege escalation control
  Info:    `allowPrivilegeEscalation` attribute is not set to `false`. Processes
           could elevate current privileges via known vectors, for example SUID
           binaries
